<font size="3"> The API Key authentication is required for inbound HTTP/SOAP/REST-based integration to Manage.</font> 

- The API Key needs be generated from the Administration Work Center.
- The HTTP request header must include the API Key.
- No other authentication including native authentication is supported. 

### Messaging Queues

- Migrate to Kafka or another supported provider (JMS 1.1) is required.
   - **JMS Provider**
       - Install/Provision/configure JMS provider (for example IBM MQ).
       - Register the JMS provider queues in Manage.
       - Associate the registered queues with the External Systems application. 
       - The queues and connection factories needs be registered in Manage in the server.xml file (Liberty) for the JMS provider. Follow the [Liberty documentation](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSEQTP_liberty/com.ibm.websphere.wlp.doc/ae/twlp_msg.html) for setup.

   - **Kafka**
      - Install/Provision/configure Kafka.
      - Register Kafka as a messaging provider in Manage. 
      - Register Kafka topics in Manage.
      - Associate the registered topics with the External Systems application. 
      - Kafka information link: [Kafka providers](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSLKT6_7.6.1.2/com.ibm.mif.doc/providers/c_mssg_providers_op.html)
      - Note: There is no text support for Kafka in the initial release. Only byte messages are supported. JMS supports both (text and byte).

<p></p>

- If already using a supported JMS provider (for example MQ)
	- The queues and connection factories should be registered in server.xml in Liberty server deployment using the same JNDI name as registered in the Manage.

<font size="3.5">The upgrade process will not move your current JMS integration messages. All messages in the queue and error table need to be processed and cleared before the upgrade.</font>
<p></p>
<font size="3">File loading folders should be processed before the upgrade and will not be moved. </font>

  - You need to configure a volume mount during deployment.

<font size="3"> Web Services using SOAP 1.1 and 1.2 are supported.</font> 

<p></p>
    
<font size="3.5">Remote Method Invocation (RMI) is replaced by REST API.</font>

- RMI is not supported outside of the Maximo server process.
   - Security issues to the containers to open RMI ports.
   - Networking issues with K8s services and routes redirecting to RMI ports.
- Recommend customers to leverage Maximo REST APIs instead of RMI.
   - Maximo REST API follow open standards and are more secure and can be scaled.
   - Use of REST API with standard HTTP/s protocol helps make the client code language agnostic.
   - For REST APIs the Maximo API Key is used for authentication.
