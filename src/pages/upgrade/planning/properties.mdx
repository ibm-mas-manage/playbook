- The Maximo property (maximo.properties) file is no longer used in Manage. 
- The bootstrap properties such as database username and password, encryption keys are set through deployment MAS UI (or CR) as ConfigMap/Secret in the OpenShift. These properties are applied to all workload deployments.
- The workload/bundle level properties are applied to the specific server and set through MAS UI and stored as a ConfigMap in the OpenShift (see Configuration section for details).
- Use the System Properties application to set the other properties. These properties are applied to all the workloads.
